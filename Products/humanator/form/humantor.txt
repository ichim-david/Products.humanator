Humanator in a formlib form
--------------------------

Just add humanator field to your schema, and away you go:

  >>> from zope.interface import Interface
  >>> from Products.humanator.form import Humanator
  >>> class HumanatorSchema(Interface):
  ...     humanator = Humanator(
  ...         title=_(u'Type the code'),
  ...         description=_(u'Type the code from the picture shown below or '
  ...                       u'from the audio.'))

and formlib will take care of the rest. The widget associated with this field 
will render the captcha and verify the user input automatically.

TODO: turn this into a proper doctest testing the widget.
